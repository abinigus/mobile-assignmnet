# campus journey 

our app is specifically used for college students which resides in a ceratin campus. it makes it possible to post any kind of tech events, seminars, gallarys, vacations trips etc which are supposed to certain students of the campus. All this things are posted and managed by the student admins. other feature of the app is, normal user of the app could post any kind of item that he or she dosent need any more, for sale. it could be ruler , laptop, smart phone, wifi routers,charger etc. the best part and other busiiness feature of this app is , normal users are able to save any event they see and any item the come accross with to the "save to later" feature of the app. users are able to perform any of the CRUD oprations on items and posts in the "save to later" list. 

if the events are supposed to specific portion of the students , with the power of authorization we are able to display this events to the excat  user.  for example if it is supposed to 3rd year and above students, users below this limit will not see the result.

identification number, year, department and some other information are stored about all the students in advance. so when a user trys to craete an account he will provide his ugr first. then he needs to answer all the sebsquent questions to make sure he is the right student .
